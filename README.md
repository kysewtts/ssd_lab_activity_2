# ssd_lab_activity_2

### This repository contains all the source files for the second lab activity of System Software development lab.

1.) Instructions for first question `q1.sh`

- To run the script, run the command
  `./q1.sh provide_file_path_here`

---

2.) Instructions for the second question `q2.sh`

- I tried running the command `cat /etc/shells` on my MAC but it is not listing down all the shells. Instead it list out binary characters which are not readable. So for the purpose of this question, I have created a txt file and added some shell names randomly. My txt file looks like:-

```/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/screen
```

- Now I have provided the filePath of this txt file while running the script. To run the script, run the command
  `./q2.sh provide_path_to_txt_file`
